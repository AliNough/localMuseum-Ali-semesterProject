                There are various ways you can support the museum. 
                Donations are very welcome and are an important way we keep this

                You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museum's collections.
                If you have some item or collection that you think others would enjoy, 
                please let us know by contacting our Collections Department and they will be 
                able to assist you.

                A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and ready 
                for visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to 
                see behind the scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, 
                and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss 
                ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
